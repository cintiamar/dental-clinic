### Performance of  Website

The performance of website pages were checked at Lighthouse Google Chrome tool. Still remain some improvements specially related to JavaScript as indicated below:

* reduce unsused JavaScript
* resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles

Note: Will be fixed as I go to the JavaScript module.

## Unfixed Bugs

In the About Us section of the homepage, there is a focus style which should be focused at the same time in one click.
For this style, there are JavaScript resources.
Will be fixed during JavaScript module
